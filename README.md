## Campaign Tracker
### Way of Thinking
The campaign tracker tracks:
- Sessions: when is the next session, what happened the previous time, and track your hero/attendance points.
- Quests and actions: what did that old hag asked us to do again? No longer doubt your to do list.
- Encounters: keep track of your kills, successes, and failures.
- People and factions: names, locations, and if that NPC really liked you.
- Items and inventory: all the cool stuff you have or need to find.
- Lore and knowledge: all the DM lore dumps here.
- Continents, regions, and locations of the world.
- Library: a hyperlink page to all the cool stuff you get from the DM.
- Talent tree: if your DM uses the talent tree, keep track of your points and upgrades here.

### Way of Working
You fill in the sheets with the appropriate information.
Either after or during the session.
